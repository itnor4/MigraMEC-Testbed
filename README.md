## Overview

This repository contains the blueprint for the MigraMEC testbed, including detailed steps and network scenarios. The scenarios are designed to be utilized within the AdvantEDGE emulator and include configurations like the one on the Arno river in Pisa.

## Scenarios

### 1. Single-MEH.yaml

- **Purpose:** This configuration file presents a scenario for a single MEC Host (MEH) with multiple access technologies.
- **Usage:** Use this YAML file to set up and simulate scenarios where one MEH interacts with various access technologies.

### 2. Migra-MEH.yaml

- **Purpose:** This configuration file describes a scenario involving more than one MEH, incorporating multiple access technologies.
- **Usage:** Use this YAML file to configure and simulate complex scenarios with multiple MEHs, each utilizing various access technologies.

## MEC Application Deployment

- **Requirement:** The MEC application deployment must be conducted within the AdvantEDGE emulator. Ensure that your environment is properly set up to support this emulator for accurate testing and validation of scenarios.
